/**
 * This mode implements the special CFB mode used by the OpenPGP standard 
 * (RFC 2440)
 *
 * <p>
 * Due to the design of the JCE, it is not completely the OpenPGP CFB mode 
 * though. OpenPGP specifies that blocksize+2 bytes need to be prefixed to 
 * the encrypted data, consisting of blocksize bytes of random data and then
 * repeating the last two bytes of this random data to make it possible to
 * check whether we're decrypting with the right key.
 * </p><p>
 * Now the question is, where should this data be added and thus also where
 * should this check be done. Inside this mode object would be the obvious 
 * choice, such that applications need not to bother themselves with this quirk.
 * However there's no way to throw an Exception if the check fails. The only 
 * possibility is a RuntimeException and that's not really how it should work.
 * </p><p>
 * So the application needs to do the check, which means the application has to
 * pass in this random data on encryption and it needs to retrieve it back on
 * decryption. For passing it in on encryption, JCE has so called 
 * AlgorithmParameterSpec objects which would be perfect for this job. However,
 * there is no way for the application to retrieve it again at decryption time
 * and therefore no way to check it.
 * </p><p>
 * So the only way to do this is if the application handles the prefix. This
 * mode then only takes care of the resynchronization at blocksize+2 bytes.
 * It's not ideal and not how is should work, but it's the only thing possible
 * within the JCE. 
 * </p>
