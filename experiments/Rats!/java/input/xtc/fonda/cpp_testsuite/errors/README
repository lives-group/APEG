These C files test SuperC error messages.

These tests are run as part of xtc's "make check" test, which uses the
SuperC regression test script, regression.sh, with the -e option.

Each file in this directory corresponds to a numbered location in the
SuperC source code.  These locations are marked with a comment
containing the text "Error location ###"
