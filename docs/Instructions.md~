How to Set up the Project
=======

We are developing the APEG project using the Java language and the Eclipse Luna IDE.
We also are using the ANTLR v4 tool for automatic generate the parser code and the plugin for working with it on Eclipse (see https://github.com/jknack/antlr4ide for more details about the ANTLR plugin for Eclipse).
