/**
 * <p>
 * This interface is used to define post parsing optimizations on a parsed tree.
 * It also includes the optimization of parse error.</p>
 * <p>
 * The reason for the existence of this interface is because the automatic
 * generators of parsed trees and errors simply include all possible information
 * regarding each step involved in the generation or either a tree or an error.</p>
 * <p>
 * Most applications will, however, want to trim many of the possible causes for
 * an error (such as blanks, or high-level types) and just keep those of terminals
 * or simple sintactical components. Also, a parsed tree will have nodes for every
 * single step in the sintactic hierarchy of the grammar for a given parsed text,
 * even if thestep is just a placeholder for a multi-case matching. In these cases,
 * most applications would benefit from collapsing such long branches in the tree
 * to more compact semantically meanningful nodes.</p>
